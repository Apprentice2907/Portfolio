# 🧠 Prince Bhadania — Creative Developer Portfolio

Welcome to the source code of my **personal developer portfolio**, hand-crafted with React, Tailwind CSS, and Locomotive Scroll — fully inspired by the stunning design language of the **Miranda Paper Portfolio**.

This is not a clone — it's a **self-coded tribute** with my own creative flair, animations, project showcases, and storytelling elements. Explore how I blend design with development to bring ideas to life.

## 🧠 Inspiration

> This portfolio is inspired by the layout and editorial vibes of the [_Miranda Paper Portfolio_](https://miranda.work/)  
> I was blown away by its structure and minimalism — so I built my own **custom-coded version** from scratch to reflect my style as a full-stack & creative developer.
